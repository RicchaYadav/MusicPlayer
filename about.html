            <p>At a time when music bands break up over small disagreements or creative differences, Sanam Puri (vocalist), Samar Puri 
                (guitarist), Venky S (bass guitarist) and Keshav Dhanraj (drummer) of the 13-year-old band Sanam thrive on togetherness. 
                Band Sanam has carved a niche in the music industry with its mix of original music and covers of classic Hindi film songs. 
                The Mumbai-based band is proud to have created a musical family. “When people think of bands, they always assume conflicts and disagreements
                 because four different minds are working together,” says Keshav, adding, “Disagreements are a part of life; How we choose to deal with them 
                 is what makes the difference.”</p>
